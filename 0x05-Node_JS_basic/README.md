# 0x05. NodeJS Basics

Node.js has revolutionized the way web applications are built, enabling the use of JavaScript for server-side scripting. With its non-blocking I/O architecture and vast ecosystem of libraries, it's no wonder that Node.js has gained immense popularity. In this repository, I will explore this technology through a range of mini projects that cover key aspects of Node.js.
